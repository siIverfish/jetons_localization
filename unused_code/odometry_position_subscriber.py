This class (and the AprilTagPositionSubscriber)  *seem* simple, but actually do not work very well as traditional iterators. 
The assumption about this iterator is that every time the robot publishes a value, it is collected in a queue and eventually fed out via the next method.
However, this class doesn't have a queue: rather, there is a single `last_result` value updated whenever the loop runs. 
If you read this as normal, non-generator code, it seems like it would continuously update and output values.
But it is not. Because of the gap after each yield statement as the localizer runs, it will *skip multiple values* that are never retrieved. In fact, when the next method is called, it will:
    a. return the value it gets polling network tables because it recognizes that it's a new value.
    b. poll and get the same value as last time (should be rarer, might never happen) in which case it'll re-poll until it gets something new.

Basically, the point is that the next() method will *always* return the most recent value. This circumvents problems with the iterators getting out of sync as one goes faster than the other.
